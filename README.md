# Pokémon-like CLI Game

A simple text-based adventure game inspired by Pokémon, built in Python. I want this to be out of distribution, so it's a good test for AI's long term planing, reasoning, and agency. 

## TODO

- Implement core game entities (Creatures, Moves, Player)
- Build the battle engine
- Develop the world map/exploration system
- Add saving/loading
- Enhance CLI interaction
